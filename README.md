just a basic mod downloader and (soon to be) manager for stuff like mojolauncher and povjavlauncher and etc written in swing

warning: kinda my second "big" java project, except bad code, like a lot.

# THIS JAR REQUIRES JAVA 17 RUNTIME, POJAV OR MOJO CANT RUN JARS ON 21 NOR THE JAR ITSELF CAN RUN WITH RUNTIME 8
